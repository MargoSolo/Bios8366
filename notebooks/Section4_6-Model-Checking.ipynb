    "\n",
    "This example was taken from Gelman *et al.* (2013):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A study was performed for the Educational Testing Service to analyze the effects of special coaching programs on test scores. Separate randomized experiments were performed to estimate the effects of coaching programs for the SAT-V (Scholastic Aptitude Test- Verbal) in each of eight high schools. The outcome variable in each study was the score on a special administration of the SAT-V, a standardized multiple choice test administered by the Educational Testing Service and used to help colleges make admissions decisions; the scores can vary between 200 and 800, with mean about 500 and standard deviation about 100. The SAT examinations are designed to be resistant to short-term efforts directed specifically toward improving performance on the test; instead they are designed to reflect knowledge acquired and abilities developed over many years of education. Nevertheless, each of the eight schools in this study considered its short-term coaching program to be successful at increasing SAT scores. Also, there was no prior reason to believe that any of the eight programs was more effective than any other or that some were more similar in effect to each other than to any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given the estimated coaching effects (`y`) and their sampling variances (`s`). The estimates were obtained by independent experiments, with relatively large sample sizes (over thirty students in each school), so you it can be assumed that they have approximately normal sampling distributions with known variances variances.\n"
